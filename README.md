# FDE-Net
This repository contains the implementation of FDE-Net, a deep learning framework for parcel-based cropland change detection using satellite imagery. This method integrates boundary extraction, pixel-level change detection, and parcel-level voting, enabling accurate and interpretable change mapping across heterogeneous landscapes.
